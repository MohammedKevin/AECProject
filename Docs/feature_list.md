# Horizono - Feature list

* **User-Interaction with Laser-Tracking** <br>
  Horizono is based on the Pharus tracking system of the Ars Electronica Center Linz. The visitors in the Deep Space are recorded with laser trackers placed at the corners and edges. Therefore the visitors can interact with Horizono and in a way also control the Simulation

* **Resolution**<br>
  The complete simulation is based on 16 by 9 metre wall projection, an equally large floor projection. However, it is not only the large projection but the high resolution that makes Horizono more exciting. We are talking about an 8K resolution with 4 projectors each on the wall and the floor.

* **Stereo**<br>
  To enhance the experience, a so-called stereo effect is used in Horizono. The dimension is switched from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. To make this possible, 3D glasses are needed for each player. These are provided by the AEC Deep Space. 

* **HighScore**<br>
  The faster you bring the packages to the corresponding slots, the greater your chances of achieving a higher rank on the high score table. 

* **En-/Decryption**<br>
  Horizono shows and explains an easy-to-use encryption and decryption algorithm called RotX. 

* **Game**<br>
  One of the most important features of Horizono is the game scene. This scene is there for the user's experience. Here, packets are spawned on one side of the Deep Space and then have to be transportated to the associated slot on the other side of the Deep Space. The faster you get the packets to the slots, the higher your rank will be in the high score table.

* **Blackhole**<br>
  Simplicity should apply in understanding but not in playing. A black hole projected on the floor is included for this purpose. If a packet is transportated and suddenly lands on a black hole, it will disappeared and you will not get any points for this packet.

* **Packet-Stream**<br>
  The packet tower is seen as a visualisation of the packet flows for the users. Here, packets are sent from the packet tower to the satellite, which in turn sends them back.  In this way, the meaning behind a request-response transfer, when sending data, is simply understood.
